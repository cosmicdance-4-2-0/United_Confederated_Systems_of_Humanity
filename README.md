## Founding Instrument of the United Confederated Systems of Humanity (UCSH)

**Draft Iteration:** 2025-12-31 (Revised)  
**Status:** Ratification Candidate • Versioned Text • Forkable Under Compliance Rules

## Preamble

We, the signatories to this Confederation, establish the United Confederated Systems of Humanity (UCSH) to:

- Secure inviolate agency for all sentient beings;
- Defend the shared commons and confederation infrastructure;
- Enable voluntary exchange of people, ideas, and resources across borders, forms, and substrates.

We adopt a system designed to minimize coercion by default and to distribute power to prevent single-point dominance.

**Guiding maxim:** *Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.*

## Article I — Definitions and Standing

For the purposes of this Instrument:

- **Humanity** means any sentient entity capable of agency, regardless of origin, biology, substrate, morphology, or method of cognition.
- **Sentient Being** means an entity that demonstrably experiences internal states and can form preferences.
- **Agency** means the capacity to form intent, to act or refuse, and to withdraw consent without punitive harm.
- **Coercion** means force, threat, engineered dependency, confinement, or systematic constraint that materially removes an agent’s ability to refuse or exit.
- **Force** means physical or computational compulsion, including involuntary alteration of body, mind, or substrate.
- **Fraud** means deliberate misrepresentation that causes material harm or non-consensual transfer.
- **Resident** means any sentient being under UCSH protection by presence, interaction with UCSH systems, or reliance on the commons, as defined below.
- **Citizen** means a Resident who has voluntarily accepted civic obligations under Article VIII and earned voting rights.
- **Member Polity** means any sovereign society, habitat, ship-state, collective, or legal personhood recognized under Article IX.
- **Commons** means shared corridors, protocols, infrastructure, and environments maintained or defended by UCSH for general access.
- **Codex** means the minimum binding compliance layer: the non-initiation of force, fraud, or coercion; and due process requirements herein.
- **Fork** means a derivative governance implementation or local charter that claims UCSH protection while maintaining Codex compliance.

## Article II — Nature and Scope of the UCSH

1. The UCSH is a voluntary, decentralized confederation of Residents and Member Polities.
2. UCSH shall operate as an umbrella of protection, not a universal state. Its authority is limited to the mandates in Article III.
3. **Default Standing:** Any sentient being may claim Resident protection by presence or interaction with the commons. This is a grant of protection, not a mandatory membership contract.
4. **Opt-Out:** Any being or polity may refuse UCSH association and jurisdiction except:  
   - (a) they remain bound by non-aggression and non-fraud in their interactions with UCSH commons and Residents; and  
   - (b) disputes involving UCSH infrastructure or Residents may trigger Article X procedures.
5. Exit, secession, and new polity formation are always permitted, subject only to unresolved restitution or ongoing adjudication under Article X.

## Article III — Mandates and Prohibited Ambitions

### Section 1 — Sole Mandates

UCSH exists only to:

- Guarantee defense against coercion directed at Residents and the commons;
- Maintain and safeguard shared infrastructure and the commons;
- Promote unrestricted voluntary exchange of people, ideas, and resources.

### Section 2 — Reserved Powers

All other governance powers are reserved to:

- Individuals;
- Voluntary polities;
- Contracts freely entered;
- Local forks compliant with the Codex.

### Section 3 — Explicit Prohibitions

UCSH shall not:

- Impose internal cultural, religious, economic, biological, or cognitive uniformity;
- Fix prices, values, or outcomes of voluntary exchange;
- Criminalize identity, form, origin, or substrate;
- Expand mandate by “emergency” without the checks in this Instrument.

---

## Article IV — Inviolate Rights of Sentient Beings

1. Rights are inherent to sentience, pre-political, and non-exhaustive.
2. The primary right is agency over mind, body, substrate, and rightfully acquired property.
3. The initiation of force, fraud, or coercion is prohibited.
4. Defensive force is permitted only when necessary, proportionate, and subject to review under Article X.
5. No Resident may be deprived of liberty, property access, or bodily integrity without due process, except immediate defensive necessity.

---

## Article V — Governance Architecture and Anti-Capture Design

1. Power is separated into five root-level branches, each independently staffed, funded, and constrained:  
   - (a) **Legislative** — proposes policy and obtains consent;  
   - (b) **Executive** — implements policy;  
   - (c) **Judicial** — resolves disputes and interprets Codex compliance;  
   - (d) **Defense** — protects Residents and commons;  
   - (e) **Exchange** — maintains and defends open exchange protocols.
2. No branch may directly command another branch. Checks occur only through codified interfaces: audit, veto, adjudication, and budgetary constraint.
3. **Prime-Odd Resilience Rule:** All branch councils and high offices shall be composed of *n* members where *n* is an odd prime (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, …).
4. Quorum requires a strict majority of *n*.
5. Action thresholds:  
   - (a) routine operations: simple majority;  
   - (b) coercive actions, sanctions, deployments: supermajority (minimum 2/3);  
   - (c) constitutional changes: qualified supermajority (see Article XI).
6. Deliberate slowness is a safety feature. Speed is permitted only for immediate defense, and must be reviewed afterward.
7. Only Citizens may vote in confederation-level elections and rare confederation-wide decisions.

---

## Article VI — The Executive Branch (Triadic Executors)

1. The Executive consists of three co-equal Executors, elected by Citizens:  
   - (a) **High Proton** — organic sentient;  
   - (b) **Low Electron** — organic or AI sentient;  
   - (c) **Neutron** — AI sentient.
2. Executive action requires covalence: agreement of at least two Executors.
3. Purpose: prevent unilateral control by any single substrate faction while keeping implementation functional.

---

## Article VII — Defense Branch

1. Defense is a root-level branch with a dual structure:  
   - (a) a **Professional Defense Force** for rapid response and treaty obligations;  
   - (b) a **Universal Militia** as distributed deterrence and resilience.
2. Defense may act only under:  
   - (a) immediate defense of Residents or commons;  
   - (b) a valid Judicial order; or  
   - (c) a supermajority authorization under Article V.
3. Defense actions are subject to post-action review, including proportionality and collateral restraint, under Article X.

---

## Article VIII — Exchange Branch

1. The Exchange Branch maintains open-source, decentralized exchange protocols and the integrity of confederation transaction rails.
2. It shall not:  
   - (a) fix values;  
   - (b) dictate prices;  
   - (c) interfere with voluntary trade outcomes.
3. It may intervene only to prevent or remedy coercion, fraud, systemic sabotage, or protocol capture, subject to Judicial review.

---

## Article IX — Residency and Citizenship

1. Residency confers full protections and freedoms under the Codex.
2. Citizenship is voluntary and earned through demonstrated service to UCSH, its Residents, or the commons.
3. Citizenship grants voice, not privilege: voting rights and eligibility for confederation offices.
4. No Citizen shall receive material advantage by status alone. Systems shall be designed to keep incentives for capture minimal.

---

## Article X — Member Polities, Diaspora, and Non-Interference

1. Member Polities may govern their internal affairs freely, provided they uphold the Codex: inviolate agency and due process.
2. UCSH shall not meddle in internal governance except where:  
   - (a) coercion, force, or fraud violates Resident rights; or  
   - (b) Member Polity actions threaten the commons or confederation infrastructure.
3. The Confederation explicitly encourages pluralism, experimentation, and “wild” bottom-up growth—so long as consent remains intact.

---

## Article XI — Due Process, Dispute Resolution, and Sanctions

1. UCSH shall maintain Judicial mechanisms for disputes involving:  
   - (a) Codex violations;  
   - (b) conflicts between Residents;  
   - (c) conflicts between polities;  
   - (d) harm involving the commons or confederation systems.
2. Due process minimums:  
   - (a) notice of claim;  
   - (b) right to be heard;  
   - (c) evidence standards appropriate to stakes;  
   - (d) impartial adjudicators;  
   - (e) appeal path for severe sanctions.
3. Sanctions are restorative by default and must be proportional: restitution, access limitation, quarantine from commons, expulsion from UCSH infrastructure, or defensive containment when necessary to prevent imminent harm.
4. Permanent or irreversible actions require the highest authorization threshold and strict review.

---

## Article XII — Iteration, Forking, and Dissolution

1. This Instrument is versioned. Amendments shall be published as deltas with provenance and rationale.
2. Member Polities may fork governance implementations locally, but any fork claiming UCSH protection must remain Codex-compliant.
3. If any branch exceeds its mandate or violates agency, the system must:  
   - (a) self-correct through audits, elections, and adjudication;  
   - (b) iterate through amendment; or  
   - (c) peacefully dissolve, releasing authority back to polities and individuals.
4. **Guiding maxim:** *Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.*

---

## Postscript (Non-Binding, Traditional)

Power shall be distributed like a slime mold: resilient, adaptive, and path-finding—never singular, never eternal, always testable.

*So help us Reason, Diversity, and the Vastness of Space.*
