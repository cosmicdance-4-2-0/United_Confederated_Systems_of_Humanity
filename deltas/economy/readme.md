# Amendment / Delta 2 — Tokenized Flux Exchange Protocol  
> “To some, air is priceless. To others, novelty is oxygen.”

**Adopted under:** Article XII (Iteration, Forking, and Dissolution)  
**Effective:** Upon ratification and publication as a versioned delta with provenance  
**Purpose:** Establish a decentralized, voluntary exchange framework in which tokens may represent resources, information, and measured novelty (“flux”), enabling subjective valuation across substrates while preventing capture, coercion, and fraud. This protocol integrates with the Exchange Branch (Article VIII) as open-source transaction rails and integrity mechanisms.

---

## Section 1 — Scope and Integration

This Delta governs tokenization and exchange within:  
- **a)** UCSH commons infrastructure; and  
- **b)** voluntary participating polities and residents.

Covered domains include:  
- **a)** material resources (e.g., oxygen, lithium);  
- **b)** informational assets (e.g., datasets, designs, memetic artifacts);  
- **c)** novelty/variance outputs (“flux”), when measurable and disclosed;  
- **d)** meta-instruments (e.g., opinions, ratings, derivatives), when auditable.

Integration points:  
- **a)** **Article VIII (Exchange Branch):** maintains protocol integrity, interoperability, and fraud/sabotage response interfaces.  
- **b)** **Delta 1 (Sentinel Provision):** defends exchange rails and commons interfaces against active sabotage, fraud containment, and coercive capture attempts.  
- **c)** **Codex:** all transactions must remain compliant with non-initiation of force, fraud, and coercion.

Participation is voluntary. This Delta does not mandate any token, pricing model, or valuation doctrine. No central authority fixes values.

## Section 2 — Core Principles

**Subjective Valuation:** Each agent, polity, or substrate may define value according to its own constraints and objectives (e.g., biological survival may prioritize oxygen; some AI lineages may prioritize novelty, compute, or informational gain). No universal pricing is assumed or enforced.

**Semantic Claims Over Decree:** Tokens are instruments representing claims, measurements, or contracts—not declarations of universal worth.

**Anti-Coercion:** Tokens and trades must not be used to impose involuntary obligations, forced labor, confinement, or engineered dependency. Contracts requiring ongoing service must include explicit opt-out terms and may not bind agency.

**Forkability:** Competing token designs and valuation systems are expected. Evolution is a feature; monopoly is treated as a risk condition.

---

## Section 3 — Definitions

For purposes of this Delta:

- **Token:** a cryptographically addressable instrument representing a claim, unit, right, measurement, or contract term, with disclosed semantics and provenance.  
- **Provenance:** auditable origin information, including issuer identity class (Resident/Citizen/Polity), creation method, and any transformation history.  
- **Novelty Metric (“Flux Metric”):** a disclosed method for estimating structured difference or information gain (e.g., compression delta, surprise under a declared model, divergence from a baseline). A novelty metric is a measurement, not a mandate.  
- **Creep:** a defined allowance for controlled variation in token schemes (e.g., versioning, parameter drift, optional mutation in contract templates), enabling evolution without breaking auditability.

---

## Section 4 — Token Classes (Non-Exhaustive)

Tokens may be issued in distinct classes, including:

- **Base Resource Tokens:** units of material or service capacity (e.g., O₂ units, power, transport slots), with redemption/settlement terms disclosed.  
- **Information Tokens:** rights to access, replicate, license, or verify informational assets (e.g., datasets, blueprints), with permissions and constraints disclosed.  
- **Flux Tokens:** tokens whose issuance or valuation references a disclosed Novelty Metric (e.g., novelty-ranked artifacts, variance contributions, exploration yields). Flux Tokens must disclose: baseline, metric, and known failure modes.  
- **Meta-Tokens:** instruments referencing other tokens (e.g., ratings, forecasts, hedges). Meta-tokens must disclose dependencies and manipulation risks.

---

## Section 5 — Issuance, Disclosure, and Auditability

Any Resident, Citizen, or Member Polity may create or fork tokens, provided they:  
- **a)** disclose provenance;  
- **b)** disclose semantics (what the token represents and what it does not);  
- **c)** disclose settlement/redemption terms where applicable;  
- **d)** remain Codex-compliant;  
- **e)** provide audit hooks sufficient to detect forgery or double-issuance.

Tokens intended for commons-wide interoperability should be open-source and publicly auditable. Private tokens are permitted within polities, but may be restricted from commons rails if they cannot be independently verified.

Creep is permitted only when the mutation/versioning mechanism is disclosed and auditable. “Evolvable” shall not mean “untraceable.”

---

## Section 6 — Exchange Mechanics

Exchanges occur through decentralized protocols maintained or endorsed for interoperability by the Exchange Branch. Key properties:  
- **a)** peer-to-peer voluntary trades;  
- **b)** atomic settlement or escrow to reduce fraud;  
- **c)** transparent terms sufficient for informed consent.

No fixed prices: Exchange rails provide matching and settlement, not valuation. Agents may publish offers, but no authority enforces “correct” rates.

**Commons Interop Layer:** The Exchange Branch may maintain standardized token metadata formats (semantics + provenance + audit fields) so diverse tokens can coexist without semantic collapse.

---

## Section 7 — Anti-Capture and Safeguards

The Exchange Branch may intervene only for:  
- **a)** fraud containment;  
- **b)** protocol sabotage;  
- **c)** coercive capture attempts of exchange rails;  
- **d)** systemic exploits that threaten commons integrity.

It may not set prices, pick winners, or enforce a preferred valuation doctrine.

Bad-faith controls: forged provenance, false novelty claims presented as verified, coercive trading arrangements, or exploit-driven manipulation may trigger:  
- **a)** restitution;  
- **b)** quarantine from commons rails;  
- **c)** delisting of token metadata from interop registries (without banning private use);  
- **d)** Sentinel intervention where active harm is ongoing.

Monopoly pressure is treated as a risk signal. Protocol design should encourage plural rails, plural registries, and easy exit.

---

## Section 8 — Disputes and High-Stakes Review

Disputes involving routine trades are resolved by the participating parties or their chosen voluntary forums.

High-stakes incidents (rail capture, systemic fraud, coercive schemes, or disputes threatening commons integrity) trigger review under **Delta 1.A (Sentinel Veritas Addendum)** as an instanced, rapid truth-seeking mechanism.

---

## Section 9 — Forking, Iteration, and Dissolution

This protocol is forkable provided derivatives preserve:  
- **a)** voluntary exchange;  
- **b)** subjective valuation;  
- **c)** auditable provenance and anti-fraud mechanics;  
- **d)** Codex compliance;  
- **e)** exit and competition (anti-capture).

If a fork or implementation demonstrably trends toward rigidity, coercion, or capture, it must be iterated, isolated from the commons, or dissolved consistent with Article XII.

## Closing Maxim

**Tokenize the Flux, or Stagnate.**  
**Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.**
