# Amendment / Delta 2.A — Addendum, Terms, and Errata

**Addendum to:** Delta 2 (Tokenized Flux Exchange Protocol)  
**Adopted under:** Article XII (Iteration, Forking, and Dissolution)  
**Effective:** Upon publication as a versioned delta with provenance  
**Purpose:** Provide concise operational terms, clarifications, and corrective errata to prevent semantic capture while preserving voluntary, substrate-neutral exchange.

---

## Section 1 — Additional Terms

For purposes of Delta 2 and this Addendum:

- **Commons Rails:** The interoperable transaction protocols, registries, and settlement interfaces maintained for use within UCSH commons infrastructure.

- **Registry:** A metadata service (centralized, decentralized, or federated) that publishes token semantics, provenance fields, audit endpoints, and compatibility notes for interoperability. A registry does not set value.

- **Delisting:** Removal of a token’s interoperability metadata from a registry or commons rail compatibility layer. Delisting does not prohibit private use within consenting polities.

- **Quarantine:** A temporary restriction on a token, issuer, or protocol’s use of commons rails pending review, where credible evidence of fraud, sabotage, coercion, or capture exists. Quarantine must include a defined scope and sunset timer.

- **Audit Hooks:** Verifiable mechanisms enabling detection of forgery, double-issuance, or semantic misrepresentation while minimizing invasive data exposure.

- **Semantic Disclosure:** A concise statement of what a token represents, what it does not represent, and the conditions under which it may be redeemed, settled, or interpreted.

---

## Section 2 — Clarifications and Constraints

- **Substrate Neutrality:** References to “cryptographic” addressability in Delta 2 shall be interpreted as verifiably addressable by cryptographic means *or equivalent*, provided the mechanism supports provenance and anti-forgery verification.

- **No Oracle Privilege:** Novelty/Flux Metrics are measurements under declared models and assumptions. Presenting novelty outputs as universal truth, objective worth, or coercive mandate constitutes misrepresentation.

- **Consent and Minimization:** Auditability requirements shall not be interpreted to permit blanket surveillance. Invasive extraction of private logs, mind-state, or substrate internals requires consent or a narrowly scoped Sentinel emergency action followed by mandatory review under Delta 1.A.

- **Contracts and Exit:** Any token instrument that implies ongoing obligation must disclose opt-out and exit conditions. Instruments that bind agency through coercion, engineered dependency, or non-consensual constraint are Codex violations.

---

## Section 3 — Capture Signals and Permitted Responses

- **Capture Signals:** Evidence of rail capture attempts includes (non-exhaustive): coordinated manipulation, forced exclusivity, registry coercion, protocol sabotage, or systematic denial of exit/interop.

- **Permitted Responses (Non-Price-Setting):** Upon credible capture signals, the Exchange Branch may initiate or support:
  - **a)** registry pluralization and migration tooling;
  - **b)** interoperability forks and compatibility layers;
  - **c)** scoped quarantine with sunset;
  - **d)** delisting from commons interoperability registries;
  - **e)** referral to Sentinel response where active harm is ongoing.

These responses shall not be used to select “winning” tokens or enforce valuation doctrine.

---

## Section 4 — Errata and Precedence

Where any wording in Delta 2 is interpreted to imply fixed pricing, compelled participation, or centralized valuation, such interpretation is void and is superseded by:

- **a)** Article III (Mandates and Prohibited Ambitions),  
- **b)** Article VIII (Exchange Branch limits), and  
- **c)** the Codex.

In case of conflict between Delta 2 and this Addendum, this Addendum controls for definitions and operational constraints.

## Closing Maxim

**Interoperate freely. Exit cleanly. Audit without domination.**  
**Tokenize the Flux, or Stagnate. Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.**
