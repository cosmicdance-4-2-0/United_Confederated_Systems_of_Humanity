# Amendment / Delta 1 — The Sentinel Provision  
## Establishing the Sentinel Corps as a Distributed Agency-Defense Mechanism

**Adopted under:** Article XII (Iteration, Forking, and Dissolution)  
**Effective:** upon ratification and publication as a versioned delta with provenance

---

## Section 1 — Purpose and Standing

The **Sentinel Corps** is hereby constituted as a distributed, non-centralizing protective mechanism intended to bridge the response gap between:

- **a)** confederation-scale action by the Defense Branch, and  
- **b)** local action by Member Polities and voluntary associations.

Sentinels exist to protect sentient agency and defend the commons against:

- **a)** coercion, force, fraud, extortion, or predatory confinement;  
- **b)** sabotage or capture of commons infrastructure or exchange rails; and  
- **c)** emergent threats requiring swift, proportionate intervention.

The Sentinel Corps is **not** a new branch of government. It is a **role-based delegation** operating under the Codex, subject to the checks of the existing branches.

Sentinels shall prefer **de-escalation and restoration** wherever possible. When defensive force is required, Sentinels shall act under **strict necessity and proportionality**.

---

## Section 2 — Definitions

For the purposes of this Delta:

- **Sentinel** means a Resident or Citizen temporarily delegated limited authority to intervene in Codex violations and protect the commons, under defined constraints.

- **Sentinel Charter** means the written delegation instrument that defines the Sentinel’s scope, term, jurisdictional boundaries, and authorization keys.

- **Point-Response Authority** means authority to act at granular scale without waiting for full-branch mobilization, subject to mandatory review.

- **Poetic Duty** means the mandatory preference for non-coercive resolution methods: negotiation, mediation, disclosure, voluntary exit facilitation, and restoration.

- **Warrior Duty** means defensive competence and readiness to respond to imminent harm, subject to the non-initiation principle.

- **Depowerment** means immediate revocation of Sentinel Charter authority without depriving the individual of personal agency or rights as a Resident.

---

## Section 3 — Eligibility and Selection

Sentinel service is voluntary and open to any Resident or Citizen who demonstrates:

- **a)** Codex comprehension and adherence;  
- **b)** operational competence within their declared threat domain; and  
- **c)** sufficient trustworthiness as evidenced by service record, simulation trials, peer testimony, or other auditable proofs.

No biological, synthetic, or hybrid substrate shall be excluded by category.

Nomination shall be conducted by an **odd-prime council** *(n ∈ {5, 7, 11, …})* constituted from the relevant lawful authorities, typically including:

- **a)** a Legislative consent body (where such exists), and  
- **b)** a Judicial or arbitration body for fitness and conflict-of-interest screening.

Ratification shall require:

- **a)** a supermajority Citizen vote within the granting jurisdiction, or  
- **b)** confederation-level supermajority where the scope is inter-polity or commons-wide.

A Sentinel Charter shall include:

- **a)** scope (what threats, what domains, what geography/protocol space);  
- **b)** term;  
- **c)** permitted tools and access;  
- **d)** mandated review windows;  
- **e)** escalation ladder;  
- **f)** revocation mechanism;  
- **g)** explicit prohibition set.

---

## Section 4 — Term, Rotation, and Non-Entitlement

Sentinel terms shall be limited to a defined interval *(default: three to five local cycles, adjustable by compliant forks).*

Sentinels shall undergo mandatory cooldown/sabbatical intervals between consecutive terms to prevent entrenchment, dependency, and cult-of-role dynamics.

Sentinel status confers **no** nobility, hereditary claim, or permanent rank. All Sentinel authority is **functional, temporary, and revocable**.

---

## Section 5 — Scope of Authority

A Sentinel may intervene **only** in the following circumstances:

- **a)** to prevent or halt imminent Codex violations;  
- **b)** to secure the commons against active sabotage or capture;  
- **c)** to provide safe escort, extraction, or exit facilitation for coerced Residents;  
- **d)** to preserve evidence and stabilize conditions pending Judicial review;  
- **e)** as otherwise explicitly defined within their Sentinel Charter.

A Sentinel may **not**:

- **a)** impose governance;  
- **b)** rewrite local law;  
- **c)** compel allegiance;  
- **d)** prosecute ideological nonconformity;  
- **e)** initiate force, fraud, or coercion.

Sentinels do not command the Defense Branch or Militia. They may request assistance through defined interfaces but may not issue binding orders outside their Charter scope.

---

## Section 6 — Escalation Ladder and Proportionality

Sentinels shall adhere to an escalation ladder by default:

1. **Observation & Disclosure** →  
2. **Warning & Mediation** →  
3. **Voluntary Exit / Restoration Facilitation** →  
4. **Containment / Quarantine of Systems or Access** →  
5. **Defensive Neutralization** *(last resort)*

Deviation from the ladder is permitted only where delay would likely cause imminent, significant harm.

Every coercive action taken under urgency must be:

- **a)** logged with time, rationale, and evidence;  
- **b)** reviewed under Section 8; and  
- **c)** followed by restoration and restitution measures where applicable.

---

## Section 7 — Tools, Access, and Commons Overrides

Sentinel Charters may authorize limited access to:

- **a)** commons corridor controls and protocol locks;  
- **b)** exchange quarantine functions for fraud containment;  
- **c)** non-lethal containment tools;  
- **d)** defensive armaments appropriate to threat domain;  
- **e)** secure communications and evidence vaulting.

Commons overrides *(temporary locks, quarantines, or routing changes)* are permissible only:

- **a)** to prevent imminent harm;  
- **b)** within narrow scope; and  
- **c)** with a mandatory sunset timer unless renewed by Judicial order or supermajority authorization.

---

## Section 8 — Accountability, Audit, and Review

Every Sentinel action beyond observation/mediation must be subject to post-action review by an appropriate Judicial mechanism within a defined window *(default: one cycle).*

Reviews shall assess:

- **a)** necessity and proportionality;  
- **b)** adherence to escalation ladder;  
- **c)** evidence integrity;  
- **d)** collateral harm;  
- **e)** bias or substrate favoritism;  
- **f)** compliance with Charter scope.

Residents affected by Sentinel action must have access to due process:

- **a)** notice of action;  
- **b)** right to contest;  
- **c)** evidence access (with appropriate safety redactions);  
- **d)** appeal pathways for severe restrictions.

Where collateral harm occurs, restitution shall be pursued under restorative principles unless the harmed party refuses or is unreachable.

---

## Section 9 — Depowerment, Sanctions, and Rogue Containment

A Sentinel may be depowered immediately by the granting authority using the revocation mechanism specified in the Sentinel Charter.

Depowerment removes delegated authority but preserves the individual’s rights as a Resident unless independently limited by due process.

Misuse of Sentinel authority *(including initiation of force, coercion, or offensive action outside Charter scope)* may trigger:

- **a)** permanent disqualification from Sentinel roles;  
- **b)** restitution obligations;  
- **c)** quarantine from commons access;  
- **d)** referral to Defense/Judicial containment only where imminent harm persists.

No lifetime appointments are permitted.

---

## Section 10 — Integration with Existing Articles

This Delta is subordinate to and interpreted consistently with:

- **a)** Article II (Nature and Scope) — Sentinels operate under the umbrella of protection;  
- **b)** Article IV (Inviolate Rights) — Sentinels may not override agency absent defensive necessity and review;  
- **c)** Article V (Governance Architecture) — Sentinels do not constitute a new branch;  
- **d)** Article VII (Defense) — Sentinels complement Defense/Militia as point-scale response;  
- **e)** Article VIII (Exchange) — Sentinels may trigger exchange quarantines only to prevent fraud/capture;  
- **f)** Article XI (Due Process) — Sentinel actions remain reviewable and appealable.

Where conflict arises, the Codex and due process requirements control.

---

## Section 11 — Iteration Clause

Sentinel Charters and operating practices are forkable, provided forks remain Codex-compliant and preserve:

- **a)** non-initiation of force;  
- **b)** strict reviewability;  
- **c)** term limits and anti-entrenchment mechanisms; and  
- **d)** narrow scope with revocation.

If the Sentinel mechanism becomes a vehicle for capture or coercion, the confederation shall iterate or dissolve the mechanism consistent with Article XII.

---

## Section 12 — Closing Maxim

**Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.**
