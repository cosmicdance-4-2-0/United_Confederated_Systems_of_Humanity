# Amendment / Delta 1.A — Sentinel Veritas Addendum

**Addendum to:** Delta 1 (The Sentinel Provision)  
**Adopted under:** Article XII (Iteration, Forking, and Dissolution)  
**Effective:** Upon publication as a versioned delta with provenance  
**Purpose:** To define a Sentinel-only, instanced truth-seeking adjudication protocol for edge cases requiring rapid, bias-resistant review **without** constituting a permanent judiciary.

---

## Section 1 — Scope and Non-Claim

This Addendum governs **Sentinel matters only**, including:

- **a)** Sentinel post-action reviews involving coercive measures  
- **b)** Allegations of Sentinel Charter misuse or overreach  
- **c)** Inter-polity incidents involving Sentinels where no shared forum exists  
- **d)** Urgent commons-protection incidents requiring immediate stabilization and rapid review  
- **e)** Any proposed Sentinel-linked sanction classified as **severe** or **irreversible**

This Addendum **does not** establish a permanent court, bench, or judiciary. It defines an **instanced review mechanism** that dissolves per case.

Nothing in this Addendum expands Sentinel authority beyond Delta 1. It governs **review**, not **mandate**.

---

## Section 2 — Core Maxim and Three-Edge Method

**Truth is a Three-Edged Sword** and must be stress-tested through three epistemic inputs (“Edges”):

- **a) Claim Edge** — the claimant’s narrative, evidence, and model of events  
- **b) Response Edge** — the respondent’s counter-narrative, contradictions, defenses, and alternate model  
- **c) Outside Edge** — adversarial probing that attacks both models via contradiction testing, predictive checks, and synthesis  

Sentinel reviews of high-stakes actions shall not rely on a single perspective, single tool, or single substrate.

---

## Section 3 — Instanced Veritas Triad

High-stakes Sentinel matters shall convene an **Instanced Veritas Triad** (“Triad”), constituted per case and dissolved upon resolution.

The Triad consists of three role-holders corresponding to the Edges:

- **a) Claim Edge Representative** — appointed by the claimant  
- **b) Response Edge Representative** — appointed by the respondent  
- **c) Outside Truth-Seeker** — selected by confederation process, representing neither party  

**Eligibility:** Each role-holder must be a Resident or Citizen in good standing, disclose material conflicts, and accept the **Oath of Method** (Section 7). No substrate category is excluded.

---

## Section 4 — Appointment of the Outside Truth-Seeker

The **Outside Truth-Seeker** shall be selected from a qualified pool using an auditable confederation process combining:

- **a)** An odd-prime selection council drawn across substrates; and  
- **b)** Conflict-of-interest screening  

**Executive Safeguard:** The Executive Triad (**High Proton, Low Electron, Neutron**), acting jointly, may veto an Outside candidate **only** for:

- **a)** Undisclosed material conflict  
- **b)** Proven incompetence or fraud  
- **c)** Verified susceptibility to direct control by either party  

Vetoes must be logged with reason codes and supporting evidence. Veto authority shall not be used to select preferred outcomes.

---

## Section 5 — Activation, Timeboxes, and Anti-Stall

A Triad instance activates when all three role-holders accept within a defined timebox.

If a role-holder declines or times out:

- **a)** The appointing party must replace within a second timebox  
- **b)** Failing replacement, the role-holder is assigned by lottery from the qualified pool  

Patterned refusal or sabotage of instancing may be treated as evidence of bad faith under Section 10, subject to logged findings.

---

## Section 6 — Procedure: Trial by Logical Combat

Proceedings shall occur in structured rounds designed to force falsifiability:

**Thesis → Counter → Outside Probing → Synthesis**

The Outside Edge must actively attack both party models and document:

- **a)** Assumptions tested  
- **b)** Contradictions found  
- **c)** Plausible alternate explanations remaining  
- **d)** Rationale for the final synthesis under the Codex  

Evidence handling must preserve provenance, minimize tampering risk, and maintain replayability consistent with Section 8.

---

## Section 7 — Oath of Method

All three role-holders shall bind themselves to method constraints:

- Do not falsify or tamper with evidence  
- Disclose material conflicts  
- Submit claims to adversarial probing  
- Prefer coherent synthesis over loyalty where contradictions are proven  

Violation of the Oath of Method triggers Section 10 consequences.

---

## Section 8 — Tools, Logs, and Minimization

Permitted tools include evidence vaults, simulation rigs, logic engines, and contradiction detectors **only if** outputs are:

- **a)** Replayable  
- **b)** Auditable (assumptions and parameters disclosed to the extent consistent with safety)  
- **c)** Plural where alternatives exist (no single oracle)  

All sessions must generate a replay log sufficient for audit and appeal. Logs may be redacted only to prevent disproportionate harm, with sealed annexes preserving reviewability.

Truth-seeking does not authorize unlimited extraction. Invasive access to mind-state, substrate internals, or private logs requires consent or a narrowly scoped emergency authorization under Delta 1, followed by mandatory review.

---

## Section 9 — Findings and Thresholds

Findings of fact require **covalence**: alignment of at least two of the three role-holders on the core synthesis.

Disposition thresholds scale with stakes:

- **Routine outcomes** (restitution, repair directives, mediated exit): **2-of-3**  
- **Severe but reversible** (temporary quarantine, access limits, depowerment): **unanimous** *or* **2-of-3 + automatic rapid Executive Veritas review (Section 11)**  
- **Irreversible actions** (permanent commons expulsion, indefinite containment): **unanimous + Executive Veritas review**

Every disposition must include: findings, evidence basis, contradiction tests performed, dissent notes (if any), and sunset/review schedules where restrictions apply.

---

## Section 10 — Safeguards and Bad-Faith Controls

Bad faith includes: forged credentials, concealed material conflicts, evidence tampering, deliberate procedural sabotage, or repeated refusal intended to stall.

Consequences may include disqualification from Triad service, restitution, access limitation, or other proportionate measures—but only after logged findings under this Addendum.

---

## Section 11 — Executive Veritas Option

For urgent Sentinel incidents, commons threats, or disputes where neutrality cannot be credibly instantiated in time, the confederation may convene **Executive Veritas**:

- **a)** The Executive Triad serves collectively as the Outside Truth-Seeker; or  
- **b)** Where explicitly authorized for Sentinel review, the Executive Triad serves as the full Triad  

Executive Veritas must meet or exceed the same requirements for: logging, replayability, minimization, and thresholding.

Executive Veritas is instanced and dissolves per case; it does not create a permanent bench.

---

## Section 12 — Dissolution Clause

Upon final disposition, logging, and publication of the required record (with redactions as permitted), the Triad instance dissolves automatically and retains no continuing authority.

---

### Closing Maxim

**Truth is a Three-Edged Sword. Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.**
